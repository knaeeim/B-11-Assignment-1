            <p>Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has said many things about poverty, entrepreneurship, and social change. Here are some of his quotes: "If you want to get people out of poverty, don't look at the poor people. Look at the system that is responsible for creating that poverty". "All human beings are entrepreneurs, but many don't have the opportunity to find that out"."The poor are like Bonsai trees. There is nothing wrong with their seeds. Only society never gave them a base to grow on"."Making money is happiness. Making other people money is super happiness". "To overcome poverty and the flaws of the economic crisis in our society, we need to envision our social life". "All human beings need financial oxygen for survival, otherwise they will be weak". </p>
